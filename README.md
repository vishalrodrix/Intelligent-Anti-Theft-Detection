# **Intelligent Anti-Theft Surveillance System**

## **Abstract**
The **Intelligent Anti-Theft Surveillance System** is a smart security solution that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect potential threats in real time. This system is designed to identify weapons, masked individuals, and suspicious activities such as running or fighting. It incorporates advanced models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for weapon detection, a CNN-based model for face mask recognition, and the SORT tracking algorithm for activity monitoring. With automated alerts such as email notifications, voice messages, and buzzer activation, the system ensures a swift and effective response to potential threats. This solution is ideal for securing public areas, corporate spaces, and residential complexes.

## **Introduction**
Modern security challenges demand smarter solutions. Traditional surveillance systems often fall short due to their reliance on manual monitoring, which can be slow, error-prone, and reactive rather than proactive. Leveraging advancements in machine learning and computer vision, this system aims to overcome these limitations by automating threat detection and providing real-time alerts.  

### **Key Features:**
1. **Weapon Detection**: A YOLO-based model identifies weapons in video feeds.  
2. **Face Mask Detection**: A CNN model detects individuals attempting to conceal their identity.  
3. **Suspicious Behavior Tracking**: The SORT algorithm analyzes human movements and flags unusual activities based on speed thresholds.  
4. **Automated Alerts**: The system triggers email notifications, voice announcements, and buzzer activations upon detecting threats.

This makes the system ideal for applications in public spaces, offices, and homes.

## **Problem Statement**
Traditional surveillance systems face several challenges:
- Dependence on manual monitoring, which is inefficient and prone to human error.  
- Lack of real-time threat detection for weapons and masked individuals.  
- Delayed responses to critical situations.  
- Limited ability to identify suspicious behaviors such as running or fighting.  

This project aims to provide an automated, proactive solution to these issues.
